# Data Mining WS24/25

Welcome to the repository for the Data Science projects of the course **[Data Driven Modeling WS2425]** at **[TH Köln]**. This repository serves as a workspace for the different groups of the course to develop, document, and share their projects with the course instructors and other participants.

## Overview

In this repository, each group has its own section to work on their projects. Each group is responsible for managing their files, code, and documentation within their assigned folder.

### Repository Structure

Each group will later receive a folder named after its group and will work within this folder. The following components should be found in each folder:

### Description of Main Folders

- **data/**: This folder contains all datasets. The data is divided into:
  - `external/`: Data and statistics collected from external sources.
  - `processed/`: Processed data generated during the project.
  - `raw/`: Raw, unprocessed data in its original state.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks are stored here, containing analyses and visualizations.

- **code/**: Python scripts or other relevant code files.

- **README.md**: A file where progress and ideas are documented.

## Project Description

### Course Objective

The course **[Data Driven Modeling WS2425]** aims to provide students with an in-depth understanding of Data Science methods and tools. Students work in groups on a real-world Data Science project, applying the knowledge gained from lectures in practice.

### Project Milestones

The project consists of the following milestones:
- [M1: Business Understanding]
- [M2: Data Understanding]
- [M3: Data Preparation]
- [M4: Modelling]
- [M5: Evaluation]

## Repository Usage

This is a **preliminary repository** with the data and basic information for the project. You will be assigned a working repository once your groups have been defined.
Everything below is valid after the formation of the groups. 

### For Group Members

1. **Your Section**: Use your assigned group folder to organize your projects.
2. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update your files and document progress in the README file within your group folder.
3. **Branching** (optional): Use branches for significant changes or milestones, which can later be merged into the `main` branch via Pull Requests.

## Guidelines and Requirements

- **Deadline**: Projects must be submitted by **[Date]**.
- **Documentation**: Each group must provide complete documentation of their project, including a project description, analysis results, and a reflection on the work with a work-distribution matrix.
- **Submission Process**: Projects will be submitted through **[submission procedure]**.

## Contact and Support

For questions or issues, you can reach out to **[Lukas Bader]** or create an **Issue** in the repository.
